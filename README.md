# Vault StreamNative Secrets Plugin

The Vault StreamNative Secrets Plugin for for [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) allows you to serve dynamic JWTs for your [StreamNative.io](https://www.streamnative.io/) service accounts. StreamNative is a service which provides [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org) as a service. These JWTs can be used directly by your Pulsar clients to authenticate.

## Usage

Quick start: build and run a development Vault server with this plugin loaded.

```
# Build Mock plugin and start Vault dev server with plugin automatically registered
$ make
# Open a new terminal window and export Vault dev server http address
$ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
# Enable the Mock plugin
$ make enable
```

Load your StreamNative service account key into vault, and read back a token. These instructions use [snctl](https://docs.streamnative.io/cloud/stable/quickstart/quickstart-snctl), the StreamNative CLI, but you may also download your service account key file from the StreamNative web console.

```
# Configure snctl and log in
snctl config init
snctl login
# Save a key for your service account
snctl -n my-app-org auth export-service-account my-service-account --key-file my-service-account-key.json

# Write your service account key to vault
$ vault write /snio/my-service-account organization=my-app-org cluster=my-cluster key-file=@my-service-account-key.json
Success! Data written to: snio/my-service-account
# Read back a new temporary token
$ vault read /snio/my-service-account
Key      Value
